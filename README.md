# Exploratory-Analysis-and-Pre-processing
In this project, we perform an Exploratory Analysis and Pre-processing on a dataset containing information about banks. The dataset includes both numerical and categorical features, and our goal is to understand the relationships between the features and identify any data quality issues that need to be addressed. We begin by exploring the distributions and correlations of the numerical features, and then we move on to analyzing the distributions and frequencies of the categorical features. We also preprocess the dataset by discarding irrelevant features, encoding binary features as [0,1], and converting nominal features with more than two values into dummy variables. Finally, we prepare the preprocessed dataset for further analysis and modeling.
